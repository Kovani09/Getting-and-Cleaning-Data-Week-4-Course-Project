# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA WEEK 4 PROJECT 
Kovani Pillay

## Description
This code book summarizes the data and variables in tidyData.txt -- this is the output of the Week 4 project in the JHU course Getting & Cleaning Data while providing
information on the Data Set and Attributes used from the original study

## Data Set details
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attributes details
### For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# RUNANALYSIS SCRIPT DETAILS

The run_analysis.R Script was designed to:
Input UCI HAR Dataset downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
        1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
        3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
        5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
      

## 1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
The targeted text files were imported to read data from the files into the variables. Files were imported individually and applicable files were then merged into sets, first all files in the TRAINING set then all files in the TEST set. This was done prior to merging the two sets into one larger data set. The features and activity_labels files had column names assigned but were not merged and will be used later.


## 2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean & standard deviation for each measurement
Merged data was then subsetted to only keep the relevant columns. Subsetted Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation as well as the data frame Data by selected names of Features. Checked the structures of the data frame Data. 


## 3. Rename activities in data set with descriptive activity names
'activity_labels.txt' was merged with the subsetted data to add descriptive activity names to merged and subsetted data set. Values in 'activity' column were then replaced with the matching values from the 'activityType' column in order to make the data easier to read.  
 

## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descritive variable names 
Used the 'gsub' function to clean up the column names in merged & subsetted data set. 'activityType' column removed in order to tidy data further.

## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set and output it 
New table was created which contains average for each variable for each activity and subject.
